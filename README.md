# Simple-Java-game-Kulki
A basic game project from 2015 r</br>

'To do list' from time perspective would include:
- use java collections instead of 1D and 2D tables whenever applicable,
- switch from Java Swing to OpenJFX,
- definetaly more comments,
- more sophisticated match checking script.

Built and tested with OpenJDK 11.0.3.7. This program is strongly influenced by the data gathered around the Internet. Music is supported by tritonus library (http://www.tritonus.org). All 3 attached jars have to be put into built path in order for this game to compile.</br>
